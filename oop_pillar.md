# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications. OOP is a way of thinking about programming, based on real-world entities like objects, their attributes and methods.

## 4 Pillars of OOP

|Pillar|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Encapsulation|Encapsulation is the process of combining data and functions into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them.|
|Abstraction|Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user. In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.|
|Inheritance|Inheritance is the process of using details from a new class without modifying existing class. The newly formed class is a derived class (or child class). Similarly, the existing class is a base class (or parent class).|
|Polymorphism|Polymorphism is the process of using a common interface for multiple forms (data types).|

## Benefits of OOP

1. Reusability of code - You don't have to write the same code again and again. You can just import the module and use it.
2. Code organization - You can organize your code into different files for better readability and organization.
3. Readability - You can import a module with a short name, making your code more readable.
4. Efficiency - You can import only the parts of a module that you need, instead of importing the whole module.

## Functionality of the 4 Pillars

### Encapsulation - Real World Example

Let's say you have a class called `Car`. A car has attributes like `color`, `model`, `year`, `speed`, etc. You can create a class called `Car` and add all the attributes and methods inside it. This is called encapsulation.

### Abstraction - Real World Example

In the real world, you don't need to know how a car works to drive it. You just need to know how to use it. This is called abstraction.

### Inheritance - Real World Example

Let's say you have a class called `Car`. You can create a class called `ElectricCar` that inherits from the `Car` class. The electric car will have all the attributes and methods of the `Car` class, plus some additional attributes and methods. This is called inheritance.

### Polymorphism - Real World Example - overloading - overridding

Let's say you have a class called `Car`. You can create a method called `drive` that takes a parameter called `speed`. You can call the `drive` method with different values for the `speed` parameter, and the car will drive at different speeds, depending on the value of the `speed` parameter. This is called polymorphism.
